Auctions for multi-robot task allocation in communication limited environments

Nowadays, large plants such as factories, warehouses, hospitals often use robots that do most of the work. In order to better and more efficiently organize the
work of such plants with a large number of robots, those plants often use different methods of auction to divide tasks among robots. But such methods almost always
encounter problems in communication, which further complicates the division of tasks. This seminar paper studies six such methods, compares them and analyzes their
results obtained by simulation in an environment where communication is difficult. The paper briefly explains each of the presented methods, presentsways of communication,
ways to improve communication and finally concludes the effectiveness of each of the presented methods.

Keywords: robot, multi-robot system, auction, auction method, poor communication, organization, division of labor
